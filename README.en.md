# Vibe Coding Recommendations

A comprehensive guide to AI-assisted development methodology for maximizing productivity with tools like Claude Code.

**Version 2026.1**

## Overview

This project provides a standard guide for "vibe coding" - a holistic approach to software development that leverages AI tools across the entire development lifecycle, from design and implementation to verification, documentation, and operations.

The guide is based on practical experience accumulated between November 2024 and January 2026, aimed at developers who are just starting their vibe coding journey rather than those who already have established processes.
